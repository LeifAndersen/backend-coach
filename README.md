Backend Coach
=============

This is the repo where I will log my backend coach work. Eventually it may turn into something more coherent but for now its mostly just a research log.

Folders:
* acquire: A (partially) converted copy of the acquire benchmark from "Is sound Gradual typing Dead?"
* graph: A DFS algorithm with several different function call uses.
* hash-table: Hash table iteration tests.
* larceny-R6RS: Larceny's R6RS benchmarks copied here.
* larceny-benchkk: Experiments done on the larceny benchmarks. (Modified to match the relevant experiment.)
* scratch: A random assortment of tests and results.
